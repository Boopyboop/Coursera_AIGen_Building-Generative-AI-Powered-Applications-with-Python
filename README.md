Dependencies will be listed in the `requirements.txt` file as they are added.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Create a `.env` file (if needed)

You may need to create a `.env` file in the root directory to configure API keys or runtime settings:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
ENV=development
```

### Module 2: Create Your Own CatGPT-Like Website

The most recent additions and developments for the chatbot web application are located in the
`Module2_CreateYourOwnCatGPT-LikeWebsite/` folder.

#### Overview

This module demonstrates how to integrate a Flask backend chatbot with a frontend template website.

#### Project Structure in `Module2_CreateYourOwnCatGPT-LikeWebsite`

```
Module2_CreateYourOwnCatGPT-LikeWebsite/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ LLM_application_chatbot/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.py               # Flask backend application serving chatbot API and frontend
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ static/              # Static frontend assets (JavaScript, CSS, images)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ templates/           # HTML templates, including index.html for chatbot UI
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Dependencies required for this module
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

#### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the template repository for the chatbot website:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/LLM_application_chatbot
```

2. Install required Python packages:

```bash
python3.11 -m pip install -r Module2_CreateYourOwnCatGPT-LikeWebsite/LLM_application_chatbot/requirements.txt
```

3. Move your `app.py` Flask application into the `LLM_application_chatbot/` folder inside the module directory.

4. Navigate to the `LLM_application_chatbot/` folder:

```bash
cd Module2_CreateYourOwnCatGPT-LikeWebsite/LLM_application_chatbot/
```

5. Run the Flask app:

```bash
flask run
```

6. Open your browser and visit [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to access the chatbot frontend.

#### Important Notes

* The Flask app now serves the chatbot frontend (`index.html`) at `/`.
* The frontend JavaScript in `static/script.js` is configured to send user messages to the `/chatbot` endpoint on the Flask backend.
* Ensure the Flask server is running before interacting with the chatbot UI.

## Notes

- Always **activate your virtual environment** before working on the project.  
- Use the `.env` file for environment-specific settings.  
- To stop the app or server, use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
